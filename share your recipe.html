        <li>do not boil further once water separates completely.</li>
        <li>drain the curdled milk over a cloth-lined over a colander. you can use the leftover water to make soup or knead the dough as they are very nutritious.</li>
        <li>squeeze off the water completely. be careful as the curdled milk will be very hot.</li>
        <li>rinse off the curdled milk with fresh water to remove sourness from lemon juice.</li>
        <li>squeeze off the water completely. do not over squeeze as the moisture in paneer will be lost.
            hang for 1 hour making sure the water is drained completely, yet remain the moisture.
            after 1 hour, start to mash the paneer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>now prepare small ball sized paneer and keep aside. cover and keep to prevent from drying.
            in a large vessel take 1 cup sugar, 5 cup water and 3 pod cardamom.
            stir and dissolve the sugar completely.
            now boil the water for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>drop in rolled paneer balls one by one into boiling sugar water.
            cover and boil for 10 minutes or until rasgulla doubles in size.
